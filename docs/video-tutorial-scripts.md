        'transaction_amount': payment_transaction.amount,
        'payment_method': 'vipps_mobilepay',
        'transaction_date': payment_transaction.create_date,
        'success': payment_transaction.state == 'done'
    }
    
    # Send to CRM API
    response = requests.post(
        'https://crm-api.example.com/transactions',
        json=crm_data,
        headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {self.crm_api_token}'}
    )
    
    return response.status_code == 200

        'success_rate': self._calculate_success_rate(),
        'webhook_delivery_rate': self._calculate_webhook_rate(),
        'api_error_rate': self._calculate_error_rate()
    }
    
    # Send to monitoring system
    self._send_metrics_to_monitoring(metrics)
    
    # Check for alerts
    if metrics['success_rate'] < 0.95:
        self._send_alert('Low payment success rate')
```

**Scalability Planning**:
1. Transaction volume projections
2. Infrastructure scaling strategies
3. Database partitioning
