## Integration Test Architecture

### Test Structure
Each integration test file follows a consistent structure:
```python
class TestVipps[Module]Integration(TransactionCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Create test data and configuration
        
    def test_[specific_integration_scenario](self):
        # Test specific integration workflow
        
    def tearDown(self):
        # Clean up test data
```

### Mock Strategy
- **External API Calls**: All Vipps API calls are mocked to avoid external dependencies
- **Payment Processing**: Payment flows are simulated with realistic responses
- **Webhook Delivery**: Webhook processing is mocked with proper validation
- **State Transitions**: Payment state changes are simulated accurately

### Data Consistency Validation
- **Cross-Module Data**: Verify data consistency across modules
- **State Synchronization**: Ensure proper state updates across systems
- **Reference Integrity**: Validate proper linking between records
- **Transaction Atomicity**: Ensure data integrity during failures
