## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure test dependencies are installed
pip install psutil  # For memory usage testing
```

### Individual Test Execution
```bash
# Run comprehensive integration tests
python -m pytest tests/test_pos_integration_comprehensive.py -v

# Run real-world scenario tests
python -m pytest tests/test_pos_realworld_scenarios.py -v

# Run performance and stress tests
python -m pytest tests/test_pos_performance_stress.py -v

# Run edge case tests
python -m pytest tests/test_pos_edge_cases.py -v
```

### Full POS Test Suite
```bash
# Run all POS integration tests

## Test Configuration

### Mock Configuration
All tests use comprehensive mocking to avoid actual API calls:
- `patch.object()` for payment processing methods
- Realistic response simulation
- Error scenario simulation
- Network condition simulation

### Performance Benchmarks
- Order processing: < 2 seconds per order average
- Concurrent processing: 10+ simultaneous orders
- Memory usage: < 100MB increase for 100 orders
- Database queries: < 5 seconds for large datasets
- Session closing: < 30 seconds with 200+ orders

### Error Handling Validation
- Network timeout recovery
- API error response handling
- Database constraint violation handling
- Memory leak prevention
- Concurrent access protection

## Maintenance and Updates

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow existing test structure and naming conventions
2. Use appropriate test class based on test type
3. Include comprehensive mocking for external dependencies
4. Add performance benchmarks where applicable
5. Document test purpose and coverage

### Test Data Updates
1. Update test products and prices as needed
2. Maintain realistic Norwegian business scenarios
3. Keep payment provider configurations current
4. Update currency and tax settings as required

### Performance Monitoring
1. Monitor test execution times
2. Track memory usage patterns
3. Validate database query performance
4. Update benchmarks as system evolves

## Integration with CI/CD
