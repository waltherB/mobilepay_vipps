# Vipps/MobilePay Security Implementation Summary

## Task 8.1: Credential Encryption and Secure Storage

This document summarizes the implementation of credential encryption and secure storage features for the Vipps/MobilePay payment integration.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Credential Encryption
- **Fernet Encryption**: All sensitive credentials are encrypted using cryptographically secure Fernet encryption
- **Automatic Encryption**: Credentials are automatically encrypted when saved through the payment provider interface
- **Key Management**: Encryption keys are securely generated and stored using PBKDF2 key derivation
- **Master Key Support**: Support for environment-based master keys for enhanced security

### 2. Secure Storage
- **Encrypted Fields**: Added encrypted storage fields for:
  - Client Secret (`vipps_client_secret_encrypted`)
  - Subscription Key (`vipps_subscription_key_encrypted`) 
  - Webhook Secret (`vipps_webhook_secret_encrypted`)
- **Plaintext Clearing**: Plaintext credentials are automatically cleared after encryption
- **Integrity Verification**: Credential hashes are generated for integrity checking

### 3. Access Control
- **Permission Levels**: Three access levels implemented:
  - `restricted`: System administrators only
  - `standard`: Account managers and above
  - `elevated`: System administrators only
- **Access Tracking**: All credential access is tracked with timestamps and counters
- **User Validation**: Access permissions are validated before credential decryption

### 4. Audit Logging
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All credential operations are logged including:
  - Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
  - Encryption/Decryption events
  - Credential rotation activities
  - Failed access attempts
- **Risk Assessment**: Automatic risk level calculation based on action type and user permissions
- **Session Tracking**: IP address, user agent, and session information captured
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail for compliance and security monitoring

### 5. Credential Rotation
- **Rotation Scheduling**: Configurable rotation schedules (monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, annual)
- **Automatic Rotation**: Support for automatic credential rotation with approval workflows
- **Rotation Tracking**: Last rotation date and next rotation date tracking
- **Notification System**: Notifications for upcoming and overdue rotations

### 6. Security Manager
- **Centralized Security**: `VippsSecurityManager` abstract model for all security operations
- **Token Generation**: Cryptographically secure token generation
- **Hash Verification**: Secure password hashing using PBKDF2
- **Key Management**: Encryption key generation and management

## Security Features

### Encryption Implementation
```python
# Automatic encryption on credential save
def write(self, vals):
    if 'vipps_client_secret' in vals:
        vals['vipps_client_secret_encrypted'] = self._encrypt_credential(vals['vipps_client_secret'])
        vals['vipps_client_secret'] = False  # Clear plaintext
```

### Access Control
```python
def _check_credential_access(self):
    """Check if current user has permission to access credentials"""
    user = self.env.user
    if self.vipps_credential_access_level == 'restricted':
        return user.has_group('base.group_system')
    # Additional access level checks...
```

### Audit Logging
```python
def log_credential_access(self, provider_id, action_type, field_name=None):
    """Log credential access for audit trail"""
    audit_vals = {
        'provider_id': provider_id,
        'action_type': action_type,
        'user_id': self.env.user.id,
        'access_level': self._determine_access_level(),
        # Additional audit fields...
    }
```

## User Interface Enhancements

### Security Configuration Section
- Credential encryption status display
- Access level configuration
- Encryption action buttons
- Audit log access
- Credential rotation setup

### Audit Log Views
- Tree view with risk level indicators
- Detailed form view for audit entries
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Risk-based color coding

### Credential Rotation Views
- Rotation schedule configuration
- Status tracking (active, pending, overdue)
- Manual rotation triggers
- Notification settings

## Compliance Features

### Data Protection
- **GDPR Compliance**: Proper data retention and deletion procedures
- **Audit Requirements**: Complete audit trail for regulatory compliance
- **Access Logging**: All access attempts logged for security monitoring
- **Data Integrity**: Hash verification for credential integrity

### Security Standards
- **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data encrypted in database
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to sensitive operations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail for all credential operations
- **Secure Deletion**: Proper cleanup procedures for module uninstallation

## Cron Jobs

### Automated Security Tasks
1. **Credential Rotation Check**: Daily check for rotation schedules
2. **Audit Log Cleanup**: Weekly cleanup of old low-risk audit logs
3. **Security Monitoring**: Automated security event monitoring

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- Credential encryption/decryption
- Access control validation
- Audit logging functionality
- Credential rotation workflows
- Security manager operations
- Integrity verification
- Uninstallation cleanup

## Installation and Configuration

### Requirements
- `cryptography` Python package for encryption
- System administrator access for initial setup
- Proper environment configuration for master keys

### Setup Process
1. Install module with security dependencies
2. Configure credential access levels
3. Encrypt existing credentials
4. Setup credential rotation schedules
5. Configure audit log retention policies

## Security Considerations

### Best Practices Implemented
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights by default
- **Audit Everything**: Comprehensive logging of all security events
- **Secure by Default**: Automatic encryption and secure configurations
- **Regular Rotation**: Automated credential rotation capabilities

### Risk Mitigation
- **Credential Exposure**: Encrypted storage prevents plaintext exposure
- **Unauthorized Access**: Access control and audit logging
- **Data Integrity**: Hash verification prevents tampering
- **Compliance Violations**: Complete audit trail for regulatory requirements
